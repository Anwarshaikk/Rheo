# AI Venture OS — Critical Strategy (v0.3, per Universal Prompt)

*A rigorous, action-first strategy that treats you as an operator. Built to question assumptions, test hypotheses, and ship outcomes.*

---

## 0) Directive
We will explicitly track **assumptions → experiments → evidence → decisions**. Uncertain items are tagged **[Inference]** until validated. We will use ranges instead of exacts unless evidence supports precision.

---

## 1) North Star & Objectives
**North Star:** Help new or early-stage businesses reach **repeatable revenue** with a measurable **time-to-first-invoice (TTFI)** and **time-to-10 customers**.

**12-week Objectives (range-based):**
- TTFI for pilot orgs: **14–30 days**
- 10 pilot orgs onboarded; **7–10** achieving ≥ one paid invoice
- Deliverable Factory v1 (proposal/SOW/onboarding) + 3 core connectors live

---

## 2) Scope Decisions (Who we help vs. not)
**Green:** B2B agencies/services, B2B SaaS/tools, creators/consultants, DTC, local services (booking/reviews/SMS), light mfg/wholesale (RFQ→PO→Invoice).

**Yellow:** Healthcare clinics (no PHI in-system), education at scale, nonprofits/grants, B2G vendors (no procurement guarantees). Partner referrals where needed.

**Red:** Fintech custody/KYC, defense/ITAR, pharma/biotech/med devices, high‑risk crypto, cannabis (jurisdictional), adult content, heavy factory ops.

**Rationale:** Regulatory exposure, physical-world execution, or enterprise controls beyond v1 scope.

---

## 3) ICP Priorities (initial mix, adjustable)
- Tier A: **B2B Agencies/Services**, **B2B SaaS**
- Tier B: **Creator/Consultant**, **DTC/e‑com**
- Tier C: **Local Services**, **Light Mfg/Wholesale** (template-driven, limited ops)

**Why:** Highest willingness-to-pay, digital workflows, fast integrations, measurable ROI.

---

## 4) Value Proposition & Wedge
**From chat to action:** not another chatbot — an **agentic execution layer** that provisions tools, generates deliverables, runs GTM plays, and enforces **stage‑gates**.

**Differentiators:**
- Opinionated playbooks with **evidence gates** (advance only when done)
- **Deliverable Factory** that outputs ready‑to‑use assets
- **Action connectors** (Stripe, HubSpot, Google, DocuSign, QuickBooks) to *do* work
- A **Business Health** dashboard that recommends next best actions

---

## 5) Product System (v1)
**Modules:**
- **Pipelines**: Validate → Plan → Form → Set Up → Launch → Run → Grow
- **Agent Team:** Visionary Designer, Market Analyst, GTM Lead, Ops & Tooling, Finance & Legal Hygiene, PM/Orchestrator
- **Deliverables:** proposals, SOWs, onboarding kits, SOPs, policies, cadences
- **Connectors:** HubSpot/Pipedrive, Stripe, QuickBooks/Xero, Google (Drive/Gmail/Calendar), DocuSign, Calendly; Shopify for DTC pack
- **Evidence Locker:** invoices, signed links, campaign snapshots

**Guardrails:** schema validation; retrieval over generation; human approval gates.

---

## 6) Service Catalog by Vertical (range-based packaging)
**Layers:** **Start (0–30d)** • **Operate (30–90d)** • **Grow (90d+)**

- **B2B Services/Agencies** — Start: ICP & offer, outbound v1, landing+booking+payment, proposal/SOW. Operate: pipeline automations, onboarding SOPs, finance hygiene. Grow: referral/partner playbooks, hiring scorecards, capacity plan.

- **B2B SaaS/Tools** — Start: positioning, demo script, trial/POC playbook, pricing experiments. Operate: analytics wiring, CS basics, renewal/expansion motions. Grow: partner/channel motion, case-study factory, light PLG loops.

- **Creator/Consultant** — Start: service menu, booking+payments, one‑pager, 2 sequences, testimonial flow. Operate: proposal→invoice automation, client portal, content cadence. Grow: productized services, retainers, community/course pilot.

- **DTC/e‑com** — Start: storefront scaffold, email flows, basic shipping setup. Operate: campaign calendar, SKU hygiene, reviews automation, analytics. Grow: LTV programs, influencer/affiliate kit.

- **Local Services** — Start: GBP + booking/reminders (SMS), estimates→invoice, review capture. Operate: schedule board, no‑show recovery, simple CRM. Grow: neighborhood offers, referral program, memberships.

- **Light Mfg/Wholesale** — Start: RFQ intake, quoting calculator, catalog & PO templates. Operate: RFQ→quote→PO→invoice pipeline, vendor SOPs, margin dashboard. Grow: distributor/rep kit, reorder triggers, basic EDI handoff.

**Limits:** no ad-spend custody, no legal/tax advice, no MES/ERP/QA or PHI custody, no field‑ops routing.

---

## 7) Packaging & Monetization (ranges)
- **Starter Pack** (one‑time): setup + first‑revenue push per vertical
- **Operate Retainer**: automations, reporting, cadence management
- **Growth Add‑ons**: partner/referral kit, hiring, LTV playbooks
- **Usage:** metered agent runs/doc generations/data enrichments
- **Marketplace:** expert playbooks/services with a small take rate

---

## 8) Metrics & Targets (evidence‑based)
- **Acquisition:** leads, meetings (20–40% from leads), proposals (50–70% of meetings), close rate (20–40%)
- **Revenue:** TTFI 14–30d; $1k, $10k, $100k milestones via ranges
- **Ops:** proposal→paid latency, invoice success rate, delivery cycle time
- **Retention:** 90‑day retention %, NPS, expansion rate

---

## 9) Validation Plan (first 30/60/90 days)
**30 days (Beachhead = B2B Agency):**
- Ship Starter Pack v1: proposal/SOW factory, outbound v1, Stripe link, HubSpot pipeline
- Run 2 channels: email + LinkedIn (20–40/day) with evidence capture
- **Gate:** ≥1 paid customer; ≥2 proposals; one public case study draft

**60 days:**
- Add QuickBooks + DocuSign + Google connectors; health dashboard v1
- Standardize SOPs; 5–10 paying customers across 3–5 pilots
- **Gate:** 70%+ pilots reach first invoice within 30 days

**90 days:**
- Autopilot light (proposal→invoice→collect); marketplace alpha
- Add Creator/Consultant pack
- **Gate:** 2nd vertical live with ≥3 paying users

---

## 10) Risk Register & Mitigations
- **Hallucinations / Quality** → schema checks, retrieval, human gates, red‑team prompts
- **Compliance exposure** → avoid custody of sensitive data; partner referrals
- **Integration fragility** → abstracted connector layer; retries & fallbacks
- **Adoption friction** → opinionated defaults, guided setup, checklists, short PoV offers
- **Churn** → weekly business review, success metrics, renewal prompts

---

## 11) Kill / Pivot Criteria
- If <30% of pilots achieve first invoice in 30–45 days despite adherence → pivot offer/vertical
- If connector maintenance exceeds value (e.g., constant breakage) → drop/replace connector
- If acquisition CAC payback consistently > 3–4 months → change channel/packaging

---

## 12) Operating Model & Resourcing (lean)
- Founder‑led GTM; contract design/ops as needed (delivery first)
- Engineering: 1 FE, 1 BE, shared prompts/schemas; QA via stage‑gates
- Support: async onboarding, templates, weekly office hours

---

## 13) Roadmap (4 sprints)
**Sprint 1:** scaffolds, Deliverable Factory v1, Stripe + HubSpot

**Sprint 2:** stage‑gates, dashboard v1, DocuSign + Google

**Sprint 3:** Autopilot light (proposal→invoice→collect), QuickBooks, Evidence Locker

**Sprint 4:** Marketplace alpha; Creator/Consultant pack; analytics polish
