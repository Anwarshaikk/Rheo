# Error Logs

## 2025-08-09: Next.js Development Server Failure

### Issue
The Next.js development server (`npm run dev`) fails to start. The command hangs without providing a specific error message, even when using different ports or the `--turbo` flag.

### Attempts to Resolve
1.  **Standard `npm run dev`:** Command hangs.
2.  **`npx next dev --port 3001`:** Command hangs.
3.  **`npx next dev --port 3001 --turbo`:** Command hangs.
4.  **Port Check:** Verified that no zombie processes are blocking ports 3000 or 3001 using `netstat` and `taskkill`.

### Hypothesis
The issue is likely not a port conflict. It could be related to one of the following:
- A dependency conflict or a bug in a recently installed package.
- An issue with the Next.js 15.x experimental version.
- A problem with the local Node.js or npm environment configuration on the Windows machine.
- A silent configuration error in one of the `tailwind` or `postcss` files.

### Next Steps
- Re-examine the project configuration files for syntax errors.
- Attempt to build the project (`npm run build`) to see if it produces more specific errors.
- Systematically remove or downgrade recently added dependencies to isolate the problem.
